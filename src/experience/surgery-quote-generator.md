### Description

An interactive surgical quote generator to provide preliminary cost information to self-funding patients on potential surgical treatments.

The application is built as a React JS SPA and is installable as a wordpress plugin and embedded via wordpress shortcode. The javascript application takes props via the localizescript api to determine the type of surgery under question, which shapes the quote process.
