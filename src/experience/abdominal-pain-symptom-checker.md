### Description

The Abdomen Pain Clinic, part of Harley Street Medical Centre, required an interactive form to provide advice and triage new patients during first contact, streamlining the patient pathway.

The form is built as a wordpress plugin using React JS and can be embedded in a page using simple shortcode.
